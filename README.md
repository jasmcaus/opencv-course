# OpenCV with Python in 5 Hours
Notes and code used in my Python and OpenCV course

## General Course Outline
### 1. Installing the necessary packages
Besides installing OpenCV, we cover the installation of the following packages:

`caer` is a powerful utilities package with tons of useful helper functions for most Computer Vision taks
<pre>$ pip install caer</pre>

`canaro` is a Python package solely for Deep Learning models built in Keras
<pre>$ pip install canaro</pre>


### 2. Basic Concepts:
    * Reading Images and Video
    * Resizing and Rescaling Images and Video Frames
    * Drawing Shapes and Placing text on images
    * 5 Commonly Used Methods in OpenCV
    * Basic Image Transformations
    * Basic Contour Detection
    
### 3. Advanced Concepts:
    * Switching between Colour Spaces (RGG, BGR, Grayscale, HSV and L*a*b)
    * Splitting and Merging Colour Channels
    * Blurring Techniques
    * BITWISE operations
    * Masking 
    * Histogram Computation
    * Thresholding/Binarizing Images
    * Advanced Edge Detection 
    
### 4. Face Detection and Recognition
    * Face Detection using Haar Cascades
    * Face Recognition using OpenCV's LBPHFaceRecognizer algorithm
    
### 5. Capstone: A Deep Computer Vision model to classify between the characters in The Simpsons
